To estimate the amount of oxygen absorbed and carbon dioxide emitted by a 125 cc engine motorcycle traveling at a speed of 50 km/h for one hour, we can use some general assumptions about engine performance and emissions.

### Assumptions:
1. **Fuel Consumption**: A typical 125 cc motorcycle consumes about **2 to 3 liters** of fuel per 100 kilometers. For this calculation, we will use an average fuel consumption of **2.5 liters/100 km**.
2. **Distance Traveled**: At a speed of 50 km/h for one hour, the motorcycle will travel **50 kilometers**.
3. **Total Fuel Consumption**: 
   $$
   \text{Fuel Consumption} = \frac{2.5 \text{ liters}}{100 \text{ km}} \times 50 \text{ km} = 1.25 \text{ liters}
   $$
4. **Oxygen Requirement**: The combustion of gasoline requires approximately **14.7 parts of air (which contains about 21% oxygen)** for every part of gasoline. Therefore, for every liter of gasoline burned, about **14.7 liters of air** are required.
5. **Carbon Dioxide Emission**: The combustion of gasoline produces about **2.3 kg** of CO2 for every liter of gasoline consumed.

### Calculations:
1. **Oxygen Absorbed**:
   - Each liter of gasoline requires approximately **14.7 liters of air**.
   - Therefore, for 1.25 liters of gasoline:
   $$
   \text{Air Required} = 1.25 \text{ liters} \times 14.7 = 18.375 \text{ liters of air}
   $$
   - Since air is approximately 21% oxygen:
   $$
   \text{Oxygen Absorbed} = 18.375 \text{ liters} \times 0.21 = 3.86 \text{ liters of oxygen}
   $$

2. **Carbon Dioxide Emitted**:
   - Using the emission factor:
   $$
   \text{CO2 Emitted} = 1.25 \text{ liters} \times 2.3 = 2.875 \text{ kg}
   $$

### Summary:
- **Oxygen Absorbed**: Approximately **3.86 liters**
- **Carbon Dioxide Emitted**: Approximately **2.875 kg**
